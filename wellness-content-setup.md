3. **Verify IsActive** is checked (‚úì) for all records
4. **Leave UsageCount as 0** and LastUsed empty
5. **Test the workflow** - N8N will randomly select from active content

## ‚úÖ **Verification Checklist:**

2. Randomly select one item from each category
3. Return a wellness package with quote + journal app + calming content
4. Update UsageCount and LastUsed fields automatically
